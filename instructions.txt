load $n ( -- x)
Pushes the value in the $n'th slot of the calling frame to the stack.

store $n (x -- )
Takes a value from the stack and stores it in the $n'th slot of the calling frame.

literal $x (-- x)
Pushes $x to the stack.

add ( n1 n2 -- n1+n2)
Takes two values off the stack, adds them, and pushes the result onto the stack.

sub ( n1 n2 -- n1-n2)
Takes two values off the stack, subtracts them, and pushes the result onto the stack.

mul ( n1 n2 -- n1*n2)
Takes two values off the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result onto the stack.

intdiv ( n1 n2 -- n1//n2)
Takes two values off the stack, floor divides them, and pushes the result onto the stack.

equal (x1 x2 -- x1==x2)
Takes two values off the stack and pushes true if they are equal and false otherwise.

less (x1 x2 -- x1<x2)
Takes two values off the stack and pushes true if x1 < x2 and false otherwise.

greater (x1 x2 -- x1>x2)
Takes two values off the stack and pushes true if x1 > x2 and false otherwise.

less-eq (x1 x2 -- x1<=x2)
Takes two values off the stack and pushes true if x1 <= x2 and false otherwise.

greater-eq (x1 x2 -- x1 >= x2)
Takes two values off the stack and pushes true if x1 >= x2 and false otherwise.

jump $label ( -- )
Performs an unconditional jump to $label

jump-if $label (b -- )
If the top of stack is truthy, jump to $label, else do nothing.

jump-if-else $label1 $label2 (b -- )
If the top of stack is truthy, jump to $label1, else jump to $label2

call $label $n (? -- x)
Calls $label as a function passing the $n'th values from the stack as arguments.
When this returns the return values from the function will be on the stack.

return
Returns from the function to the caller.
